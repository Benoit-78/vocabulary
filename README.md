**Vocabulary application**



A few years ago, I was having great difficulties to keep English words & German words in my mind.

Regularly, I met certain words in my readings, videos, ... and still I was unable to keep them into my memory.



So I wrote down these words in a list, and read proof that list every week. And every new word I encountered ended up in that list, so I was sure no to forget them anymore.

Time passed, and I created an application for that. And ever since, my app asks me 100 english words per day.



There is an Arabic sentence that says that a language is a sea without shores. Indeed, even now, I still encounter new words in Shakespeare's language.

But I encounter far more words that passed through my app, and those words are in my memory now.



I wish you the same result, happy learning!
